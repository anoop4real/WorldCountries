# WorldCountries
A sample application which shows WorldCountries and some of their details

### Flags

Images used from https://github.com/hjnilsson/country-flags

### Details

Details of the countries are taken from API http://restcountries.eu/

### Improvements

Right now only simple attributes of a country are fetched. Next step is to fetch multiple value attributes like languages, currencies etc.
Flags for some of the countries are missing, couldnt find the right sized flags.

`Disclaimer` - This app is developed as part of my sample projects. For country codes, country flags I have not done any reviews. I am relying on the above two links.
